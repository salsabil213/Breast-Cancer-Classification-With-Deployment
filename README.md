# Breast Cancer Classification with Deployment

Welcome to the Breast Cancer Classification project! This repository contains a machine learning solution to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign. The project leverages Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Neural Networks for classification and includes a user-friendly deployment using Streamlit.

## üß† Project Overview

Early and accurate detection of breast cancer can save lives. This project applies advanced machine learning techniques to classify tumors based on their features. Here's an overview of the work:

- **Algorithms Used**: 
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** 
  - **Neural Network**
- **Deployment**: 
  - We used **Streamlit** to create an interactive web application for users to classify tumors in real-time. The deployment utilizes the **Neural Network** model because it demonstrated higher accuracy compared to the SVM.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Jupyter Notebook** for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Python** for backend scripting and machine learning implementation.
- **Streamlit** for deploying the classification model as a web application.
